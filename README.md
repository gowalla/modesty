# Modesty

Modesty is a really simple metrics and a/b testing framework that doesn't really do all that much.  It was inspired by assaf's Vanity (github.com/assaf/vanity).


## Install

    gem install modesty

or in your Gemfile

    gem 'modesty'

## Metrics
A metric keeps track of things that happen, and ties in and disaggregates many different types of data.  Define a metric with:

    Modesty.new_metric :foo

Your metric will now be available as `Modesty.metrics[:foo]`.
You can track it with

    Modesty.track! :foo`,

You can get a raw count with

    Modesty.metrics[:foo].count`.

You can track multiple counts with `Modesty.track! :foo, 7`,
or, if you prefer, `Modesty.track! :foo, :count => 7`.

Simple, huh?

You can also pass in any sort of data when you track your metric.  For example,

    Modesty.track! :product_page_viewed, :with => {:product_id => 500, :seller_id => 278}

This provides you with a few more granular methods.

    m = Modesty.metrics[:product_page_viewed]
    m.unique :product_ids # => number of unique product_ids that were tracked
    m.all :product_ids    # => the actual ids that were tracked
    m.aggregate_by :product_ids # => a hash of {product_id => tracks for this product id}
    m.distribution_by :product_ids # => equivalent to aggregate_by(:product_ids).values.histogram

## Identity
To save you some hassle, Modesty keeps around a global identity in `Modesty.identity`.
You can set the identity with `Modesty.identify! id`,
where `id` is either an integer (i.e. the id of the current user) or `nil` for guests.
When the identity is present, all metrics tracked will get a `:user` parameter passed in.
This makes it really easy to call `m.unique :users` and such,
without having to pass it in every time.
To override this, just call `Modesty.track! :metric, :with => {:user => other_user}`.

If you're using Rails, I recommend putting a `before_filter` on `ApplicationController` that does something akin to `Modesty.identify! viewer.id`.

## Experiments
Experiments are really the point of Modesty.
With an experiment, you separate your users into experiment groups
and track how each group performs on a given set of metrics.
Modesty will ensure that
  * each group contains roughly the same number of users
  * Each user has a consistent experience
  * All specified metrics can be disaggregated by experiment group.

Here's how you make an experiment:

    Modesty.new_experiment :button_size do |e|
      e.metrics :conversion, :view
      e.alternatives :huge, :medium, :small
    end

Then, you can do something like this (in a controller, say)

    button_size = Modesty.experiment :button_size do |e|
      e.group :huge do
        9001
      end
      e.group :medium do
        1337
      end
      e.group :small do
        2
      end
    end

This code will use `Modesty.identity` to determine the appropriate experiment group,
and run the corresponding block.

All your tracking data will automagically be disaggregated into

    Modesty.metrics[:conversion/:button_size/:huge]
    Modesty.metrics[:conversion/:button_size/:medium]
    Modesty.metrics[:conversion/:button_size/:small]

## Statistics and reporting

TODO.

##Datastores and config

Right now there are two datastores available: Redis and a sweet mock Redis for testing.  To switch between them, use

    Modesty.data = :redis
    Modesty.data = :mock

If you need to pass in more options, use

    Modesty.set_store :redis, :port => 8888, :host => '123.123.123.1'

## Rails

By default, Modesty looks in configy/modesty.yml for something like:

    datastore:
      type: redis
      port: 6739
      host: localhost

    paths:
      experiments: modesty/experiments
      metrics: modesty/metrics

In this, the default setup, Modesty will look for experiments
in #{Rails.root}/modesty/experiments, and metrics in #{Rails.root}/modesty/metrics.
If no config file is found, or you omit something, Modesty will use these settings.
Everything in the `datastore:` stanza (sans type: redis) will be passed as options to Redis.new.

Have fun!
